## Coding solution by Danil Filatov for the Knab technical assessment.

The solution consists of three parts: web API application, infrastructure library and tests.  
To run the code you need .NET 7 SDK installed. You can get it by URL https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0  
If you don't want to install SDK on your machine you can build and run Dockerfile. There are specific configurations which can be launched using Rider.

The best way to run and view the code is to use Jetbrains Rider.  
The simplest way to run the web application is to run the command ``dotnet run`` in the directory ``KnabEngineerRecruitmentTestSolution\KnabEngineerRecruitmentTestWebApi\``
The simplest way to run tests is to run the command ``dotnet test`` in the directory ``KnabEngineerRecruitmentTestSolution\KnabEngineerRecruitmentTestTests\``
